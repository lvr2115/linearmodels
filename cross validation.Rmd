For many modern tools and in many applications, the emphasis lies on **prediction accuracy** rather than on statistical significance. In these cases, cross validation provides a way to compare the predictive performance of competing methods. 

In a basic case, you know what you need in your model and you're interested in one specific variable as a predictor to see if its important or not.

You have to figure out which model you want to use, based on the ones you can build. No model is 100% true. All we can do is approximate to a possible truth. 

```{r load packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(mgcv)
```
